StokesDavis_eLife_2014
======================
A repository of python scripts used in eLife manuscript, "Discovery of a small molecule that inhibits bacterial ribosome biogenesis"

Fitted mass spectrometry data was initially filtered for quality of fits using masse.py.

Using each of the resulting _iso.csv files, various plots for the manuscript were generated with iPython notebook scripts.

Each of the iPython notebooks will require the supplementary libraries, qMS.py and vizLib.py.
